# react-typescrip: TypeScript & React application

This project is a training project to develop an application using API, TypeScript, Node.js and React.
The overall goal is to demonstrate the skills of typescript and react for the front-end developer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project structure

The project consists of 3 pages:

```
ImgLoader: 'src/page/ImgLoader'
WeatherPage: 'src/page/WeatherPage'
```

### WeatherPage

It consists of input fields and dashboard.
In put are introduced the names of cities, which go to see the weather. The data is displayed in a dashboard container.

### ImgLoader

It consists of input fields and display areas.
Input, url is typed on pictures that you want to upload. The link is checked for the presence of a picture in it, after the link is stored in the local store and the data is displayed in the display area.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
